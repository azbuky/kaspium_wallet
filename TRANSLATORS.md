# Translations and translators

To make Kaspium usable to a broad audience, the Kaspa translators team provided translations for a lot of different languages. At this point a big **Thank You** to all involved parties!

Some hints to the table above:
* Some translations currently have no translator, so they just contain the default translations
* Some translators prefer to stay anonymous, so they are not mentioned on the list
* Some translators do not tell their Discord account name, so they are also not mentioned on the list
